### Policies

  - Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, you may not be eligible for graduation. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! Also, please show up on time. We count 2 tardies as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due **before 8am on the due date of the assignment**. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, don't say it at all! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**
