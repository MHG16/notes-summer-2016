# Day 18 - AJAX PUT POST DELETE

## Review
- turning repeated code into DRY code with functions
- filter, map, reduce functions MUST return something! Otherwise, just use forEach
  - forEach - nothing to store!
    - applies a callback function to every item in an array
    - RETURNS NOTHING. great for doing stuff, like logging or adding to the console.
  - filter
    - filters an array via boolean test,
    - returns whole items from the original array in a new arry
  - map
    - applies a callback to each item in an array
    - returns a new array full of the return value of the callback
  - reduce
    - applies a callback to each item in an array as well as the return item from the previous call
    - returns a single something, the ultimate return value of the callback
- moving the function outside the success/event listener/filter ect.

## Challenge
- use `setTimeout()` to create a button that becomes disabled and displays: 'loading...' after it is clicked. It should return to normal after 4 seconds.
